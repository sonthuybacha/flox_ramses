## flexFlox

A joint project to organize and calculate key remote sensing output metrics. Input data was collected during field-work and the next task involves filtering and calculating key optical coefficients.

### 1. Aggregating flox data

In order to aggregate raw flox data into a csv file, place the relevant flox data inside `./data/flox` and execute the following:

```shell
$ Rscript aggregate_flox.R
```

The corresponding output will be saved in the `./out` directory.

### 2. Parsing RAMSES data into json

Development underway :snail:
