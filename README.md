# flexFlox

A joint project to organize and calculate key remote sensing data using R. Input data was collected during field-work and the next task involves filtering and calculating key optical coefficients.

So far these are our branches:

1. `modified.branch` has the latest methodologies to handle data but is considered experimental. 

2. `master` has been previously tested and considered stable.
